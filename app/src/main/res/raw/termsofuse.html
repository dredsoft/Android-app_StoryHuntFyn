<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>11. COPYRIGHT POLICY</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(A) We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect users to do the same.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(B) In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 (“DMCA”), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have designated to receive notifications of claims infringement (its “Designated Agent”).

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(C) If you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and believe that your work’s copyright has been infringed, please report your notice of infringement to us by providing our Designated Agent with a written notification of claimed infringement that includes substantially the following:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.

(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the DMCA. Inquiries that do not follow this procedure may not receive a response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>12. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These Terms of Use shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Any legal proceedings against Company that may arise out of, relate to, or be in any way connected with our Website or these Terms of Use shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of Louisville, Kentucky and you waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION &amp; MANDATORY ARBITRATION</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(A) We each agree to first contact each other with any disputes and provide a written description of the problem, all relevant documents/information and the proposed resolution. You agree to contact us with disputes by contacting us at the address provided in these Terms of Use. We will contact you based on the contact information you have provided us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(B) If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised under the previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section. The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved through arbitration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(C) We each agree that any claim or dispute between us, and any claim by either of us against any agent, employee, successor, or assign of the other, including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, third parties who are not signatories to this agreement, whether related to this agreement or otherwise, including past, present, and future claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS under its rules and procedures in effect when the claim is filed. The rules and procedures and other information, including information on fees, may be obtained from JAMS’ website (www.jamsadr.com) or by calling JAMS at 949-224-1810.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(D) We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce. Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(E) </span><span class="s4"><b>Exception to Arbitrate.</b></span><span class="s1"> Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. Further, as set forth below, we each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Company, not as part of a classwide claim (i.e., not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn't apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>14. NO CLASS ACTIONS</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>15. NO TRIAL BY JURY</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>16. AMENDMENT; ADDITIONAL TERMS</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(A) We reserve the right in our sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, to modify or discontinue any aspect or feature of our Services or to modify these Terms of Use.

To the extent any Additional Terms conflict with these Terms of Use, the Additional Terms will control.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(B) Modifications to these Terms of Use or Additional Terms will be effective immediately upon notice, either by posting on the Website, notification by email or through any of our Applications. It is your responsibility to review the Terms of Use from time to time for any changes or Additional Terms. Your access and use of our Services following any modification of these Terms of Use or the provision of Additional Terms will signify your assent to and acceptance of the same. If you object to any subsequent revision to the Terms of Use or to any Additional Terms, immediately discontinue use of our Services and, if applicable, terminate your Membership.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>17. MISCELLANEOUS</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(A) No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(B) Except where specifically stated otherwise, if any part of these Terms of Use is unlawful or unenforceable for any reason, we both agree that only that part of the Terms of Use shall be stricken and that the remaining terms in the Terms of Use shall not be affected.</span></p>

Any such purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent will be null and void and of no force and effect. We may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent and without notice.</span></p>
